[Description]

The goal of the game is to collect all the Spheres in the maze.

Skeletons will attack you and will pursue you.

If your health reaches or goes below 0 you will die.

You can walk over and eat food to restore health.

Walking over arrow tiles warp you to a new location.

The flashing symbols spawn enemies.

You have 2 spells to defend yourself, a fireball and a blast of air.

Fireballs go in straight lines and tear through enemies until they hit a wall.

Air blasts are used to attack diagonally.



[Important!]

If you die you must close the program and restart it

for another try!
